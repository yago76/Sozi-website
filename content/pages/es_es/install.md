Sozi is currently provided in the form of a [zip archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29).
Unzipping the archive will create a folder with the same name.
Linux and Windows users will run Sozi by launching the `Sozi` executable inside that folder.
OS X users will find a `Sozi.app` subfolder that they can drag into their `Applications` folder.
